**Description**

This program is an international monitoring system that records where “galamsey” occur and how devastating 
they are in Africa. The program stores and retrieves information about the vegetation 
colour, colour value, position (latitude and longitude) and year of the event and also stores and retrieves 
the name of the observatory, the name of the country in which it is located, the year in which “galamsey” observations started, 
the area covered by the observatory (in square kilometers) and a list of “galamsey” events that it has recorded
